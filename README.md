# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

These files together are my Course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera module.
The following files are available:
* README.md: the guide you are reading right now
* run_analysis.R: the R script that will generate a textfile containing a tidy dataset.
* Codebook.md: the document explaining all types of variables in the tidy dataset
